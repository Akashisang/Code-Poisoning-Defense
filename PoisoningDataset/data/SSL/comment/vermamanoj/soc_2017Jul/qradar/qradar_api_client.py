# This sample demonstrates how to encode credentials, how to format and attach
# headers to an HTTP request, and how to send a simple request to a REST API
# endpoint. This script uses many python modules directly in order to
# demonstrate the low level functionality of the API. Future scripts will wrap
# this functionality into shared modules for re-use.

# For a list of the endpoints that you can use along with the parameters that
# they accept you can view the REST API interactive help page on your
# deployment at https://<hostname>/api_doc
# You can also retrieve a list of available endpoints through the API itself
# at the /api/help/versions endpoint.
