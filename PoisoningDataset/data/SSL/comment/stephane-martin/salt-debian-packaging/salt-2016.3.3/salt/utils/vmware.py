Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- pyVmomi Python Module
- ESXCLI: This dependency is only needed to use the ``esxcli`` function. No other
  functions in this module rely on ESXCLI.

pyVmomi
-------

PyVmomi can be installed via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyVmomi

.. note::

    Version 6.0 of pyVmomi has some problems with SSL error handling on certain
    versions of Python. If using version 6.0 of pyVmomi, Python 2.6,
    Python 2.7.9, or newer must be present. This is due to an upstream dependency
    in pyVmomi 6.0 that is not supported in Python versions 2.7 to 2.7.8. If the
    version of Python is not in the supported range, you will need to install an
    earlier version of pyVmomi. See `Issue #29537`_ for more information.

.. _Issue #29537: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/29537

Based on the note above, to install an earlier version of pyVmomi than the
version currently listed in PyPi, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyVmomi==5.5.0.2014.1.1

The 5.5.0.2014.1.1 is a known stable version that this original VMware utils file
was developed against.

ESXCLI
------

This dependency is only needed to use the ``esxcli`` function. At the time of this
writing, no other functions in this module rely on ESXCLI.

The ESXCLI package is also referred to as the VMware vSphere CLI, or vCLI. VMware
provides vCLI package installation instructions for `vSphere 5.5`_ and
`vSphere 6.0`_.

.. _vSphere 5.5: http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-55/index.jsp#com.vmware.vcli.getstart.doc/cli_install.4.2.html
.. _vSphere 6.0: http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-60/index.jsp#com.vmware.vcli.getstart.doc/cli_install.4.2.html

Once all of the required dependencies are in place and the vCLI package is
installed, you can check to see if you can connect to your ESXi host or vCenter
server by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    esxcli -s <host-location> -u <username> -p <password> system syslog config get

If the connection was successful, ESXCLI was successfully installed on your system.
You should see output related to the ESXi host's syslog configuration.
