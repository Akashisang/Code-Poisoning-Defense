SecureTranport support for urllib3 via ctypes.

This makes platform-native TLS available to urllib3 users on macOS without the
use of a compiler. This is an important feature because the Python Package
Index is moving to become a TLSv1.2-or-higher server, and the default OpenSSL
that ships with macOS is not capable of doing TLSv1.2. The only way to resolve
this is to give macOS users an alternative solution to the problem, and that
solution is to use SecureTransport.

We use ctypes here because this solution must not require a compiler. That's
because pip is not allowed to require a compiler either.

This is not intended to be a seriously long-term solution to this problem.
The hope is that PEP 543 will eventually solve this issue for us, at which
point we can retire this contrib module. But in the short term, we need to
solve the impending tire fire that is Python on Mac without this kind of
contrib module. So...here we are.

To use this module, simply import and inject it::

    import urllib3.contrib.securetransport
    urllib3.contrib.securetransport.inject_into_urllib3()

Happy TLSing!
