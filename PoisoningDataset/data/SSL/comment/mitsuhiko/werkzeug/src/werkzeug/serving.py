"""A WSGI and HTTP server for use **during development only**. This
server is convenient to use, but is not designed to be particularly
stable, secure, or efficient. Use a dedicate WSGI server and HTTP
server when deploying to production.

It provides features like interactive debugging and code reloading. Use
``run_simple`` to start the server. Put this in a ``run.py`` script:

.. code-block:: python

    from myapp import create_app
    from werkzeug import run_simple
