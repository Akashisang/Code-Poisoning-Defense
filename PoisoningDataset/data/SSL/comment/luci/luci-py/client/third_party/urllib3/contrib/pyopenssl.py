"""
Module for using pyOpenSSL as a TLS backend. This module was relevant before
the standard library ``ssl`` module supported SNI, but now that we've dropped
support for Python 2.7 all relevant Python versions support SNI so
**this module is no longer recommended**.

This needs the following packages installed:

* `pyOpenSSL`_ (tested with 16.0.0)
* `cryptography`_ (minimum 1.3.4, from pyopenssl)
* `idna`_ (minimum 2.0, from cryptography)

However, pyOpenSSL depends on cryptography, which depends on idna, so while we
use all three directly here we end up having relatively few packages required.

You can install them with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install pyopenssl cryptography idna

To activate certificate checking, call
:func:`~urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3` from your Python code
before you begin making HTTP requests. This can be done in a ``sitecustomize``
module, or at any other time before your application begins using ``urllib3``,
like this:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        import urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl
        urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()
    except ImportError:
        pass
