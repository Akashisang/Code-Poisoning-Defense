#  This is the config-template for Err. This file should be copied and   #
#  renamed to config.py, then modified as you see fit to run Errbot      #
#  the way you like it.                                                  #
#                                                                        #
#  As this is a regular Python file, note that you can do variable       #
#  assignments and the likes as usual. This can be useful for example if #
#  you use the same values in multiple places.                           #
#                                                                        #
#  Note: Various config options require a tuple to be specified, even    #
#  when you are configuring only a single value. An example of this is   #
#  the BOT_ADMINS option. Make sure you use a valid tuple here, even if  #
#  you are only configuring a single item, else you will get errors.     #
#  (So don't forget the trailing "," in these cases)                     #
#                                                                        #
