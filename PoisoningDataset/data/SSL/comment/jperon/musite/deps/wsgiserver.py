For those of you wanting to understand internals of this module, here's the
basic call flow. The server's listening thread runs a very tight loop,
sticking incoming connections onto a Queue::

    server = WSGIServer(...)
    server.start()
    while True:
        tick()
        # This blocks until a request comes in:
        child = socket.accept()
        conn = HTTPConnection(child, ...)
        server.requests.put(conn)

Worker threads are kept in a pool and poll the Queue, popping off and then
handling each connection in turn. Each connection can consist of an arbitrary
number of requests and their responses, so we run a nested loop::

    while True:
        conn = server.requests.get()
        conn.communicate()
        ->  while True:
                req = HTTPRequest(...)
                req.parse_request()
                ->  # Read the Request-Line, e.g. "GET /page HTTP/1.1"
                    req.rfile.readline()
                    read_headers(req.rfile, req.inheaders)
                req.respond()
                ->  response = app(...)
                    try:
                        for chunk in response:
                            if chunk:
                                req.write(chunk)
                    finally:
                        if hasattr(response, "close"):
                            response.close()
                if req.close_connection:
                    return
