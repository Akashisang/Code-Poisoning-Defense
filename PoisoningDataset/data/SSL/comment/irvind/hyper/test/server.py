~~~~~~~~~~~

This module defines some testing infrastructure that is very useful for
integration-type testing of hyper. It works by spinning up background threads
that run test-defined logic while listening to a background thread.

This very-clever idea and most of its implementation are ripped off from
Andrey Petrov's excellent urllib3 project. I owe him a substantial debt in
ingenuity and about a million beers. The license is available in NOTICES.
