# Ultimately, the design is to handle all the complicated stuff at set
# rather than get tiime.  When something is set on a group, then all
# members of that group are examined  and 'inheritedfrom' attributes
# are pushed.  as expression definned values are iinserted, their
#  dependdentt attributes are added to a private dict to aid in auto
# calculation.  When a name is changed, all attributes are re-evaluated
# on get, should be simple read value *except* for encrypted values,
# which are only decrypted when explicitly requested
# encrypted fields do not support expressions, either as a source or
# destination

# Note on the cryptography.  Default behavior is mostly just to pave the
# way to meaningful security.  Root all potentially sensitive data in
# one key.  That key is in plain sight, so not meaningfully protected
# However, the key can be protected in the following ways:
#   - Passphrase protected (requiring human interaction every restart)
#   - TPM sealing (which would forgo the interactive assuming risk of
#           physical attack on TPM is not a concern)
# This module provides cryptographic convenience functions, largely to be
# used by config.py to protect/unlock configuration as appropriopriate.
# The default behavior provides no meaningful protection, all encrypted
# values are linked to a master key that is stored in the clear.
# meanigful protection comes when the user elects to protect the key
# by passphrase and optionally TPM
