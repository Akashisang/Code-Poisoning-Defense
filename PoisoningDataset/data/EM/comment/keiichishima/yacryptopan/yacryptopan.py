"""Yet another implementaion of Crypto-PAn.

This package provides a function to anonymize IP addresses keeping
their prefix consistency.  This program is based on the paper
"Prefix-Preserving IP Address Anonymization: Measurement-based
Security Evaluation and a New Cryptography-based Scheme" written by
Jun Xu, Jinliang Fan, Mostafa H. Ammar, and Sue B. Moon.  The detailed
explanation can be found in [Xu2002].

This package supports both IPv4 and IPv6 anonymization.
