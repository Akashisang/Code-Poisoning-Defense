Description: Cryptopress translates to 'cryptography compression.'
    As the name suggests, this program
    takes an arbitrary number of files as input and
    produces a single stream of ciphertext, which
    is the AES encrypted content. Optionally, you can
    output the ciphertext to a file--an archive. Then you can
    use this program to do the inverse action and
    produce the original file(s) from the archive file.
