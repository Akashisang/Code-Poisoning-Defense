"""AES symmetric cipher

AES `(Advanced Encryption Standard)`__ is a symmetric block cipher standardized
by NIST_ . It has a fixed data block size of 16 bytes.
Its keys can be 128, 192, or 256 bits long.

AES is very fast and secure, and it is the de facto standard for symmetric
encryption.

As an example, encryption can be done as follows:

    >>> from Crypto.Cipher import AES
    >>> from Crypto import Random
    >>>
    >>> key = b'Sixteen byte key'
    >>> iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
    >>> cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
    >>> msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(b'Attack at dawn')
