Implementation Project:
Using your favorite language, implement a little app that has the following features:

    Given a (Username, Password) pair in ASCII; store the pair to a file
    Given a (Username, Password) pair in ASCII; check if the username exists and if the password matches the one stored in a file.
    Using a flag the user should be able to choose ECB, CTR or CBC modes.

Notes:
-Master Key and Init vectors are defined as global constants. This program is only working on leveraging the use of CBC, CTR, and ECB encryption modes.
