# Sample PBKDF2 usage:
#   from Crypto.Cipher import AES
#   from pbkdf2 import PBKDF2
#   import os
#
#   salt = os.urandom(8)    # 64-bit salt
#   key = PBKDF2("This passphrase is a secret.", salt).read(32) # 256-bit key
#   iv = os.urandom(16)     # 128-bit IV
#   cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
#     ...
#
# Sample crypt() usage:
#   from pbkdf2 import crypt
#   pwhash = crypt("secret")
#   alleged_pw = raw_input("Enter password: ")
#   if pwhash == crypt(alleged_pw, pwhash):
#       print "Password good"
#   else:
#       print "Invalid password"
