Idea: generate a URL of the formpointer:data which form a linked-list. We store
each link in the list in a URL shortener. The head is just a pointer and can be
retrieved at will.

# TODO
# maybe split this up into a few classes?
# have it also read form stdin
# encrypt the entire chunk (including the pointer), so no one knows the chunk order/all the chunks
#  - does this impact security?
