# Description:
#   [MS-NRPC] Interface implementation
#
#   Best way to learn how to use these calls is to grab the protocol standard
#   so you understand what the call does, and then read the test case located
#   at https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket/tree/master/impacket/testcases/SMB_RPC
#
#   Some calls have helper functions, which makes it even easier to use.
#   They are located at the end of this file. 
#   Helper functions start with "h"<name of the call>.
#   There are test cases for them too.
