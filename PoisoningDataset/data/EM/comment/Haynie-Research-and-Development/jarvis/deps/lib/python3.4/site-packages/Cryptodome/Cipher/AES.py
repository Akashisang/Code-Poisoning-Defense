"""AES symmetric cipher

AES `(Advanced Encryption Standard)`__ is a symmetric block cipher standardized
by NIST_ . It has a fixed data block size of 16 bytes.
Its keys can be 128, 192, or 256 bits long.

AES is very fast and secure, and it is the de facto standard for symmetric
encryption.

As an example, encryption can be done as follows:

    >>> from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES
    >>>
    >>> key = b'Sixteen byte key'
    >>> cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB)
    >>> msg = cipher.iv + cipher.encrypt(b'Attack at dawn')

A more complicated example is based on CCM, (see `MODE_CCM`) an `AEAD`_ mode
that provides both confidentiality and authentication for a message.

The CCM mode optionally allows the header of the message to remain in the clear,
whilst still being authenticated. The encryption is done as follows:

    >>> from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES
    >>>
    >>> hdr = b'To your eyes only'
    >>> plaintext = b'Attack at dawn'
    >>> key = b'Sixteen byte key'
    >>> cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CCM)
    >>> cipher.update(hdr)
    >>> msg = cipher.nonce, hdr, cipher.encrypt(plaintext), cipher.digest()

We assume that the tuple ``msg`` is transmitted to the receiver:

    >>> from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES
    >>>
    >>> nonce, hdr, ciphertext, mac = msg
    >>> key = b'Sixteen byte key'
    >>> cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CCM, nonce)
    >>> cipher.update(hdr)
    >>> plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
    >>> try:
    >>>     cipher.verify(mac)
    >>>     print "The message is authentic: hdr=%s, pt=%s" % (hdr, plaintext)
    >>> except ValueError:
    >>>     print "Key incorrect or message corrupted"

If no ``nonce`` is supplied initially, a 11 bytes random ``nonce`` is generated,
which is good for a maximum message size of 4G. See CCM_.
